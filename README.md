**🤖 WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF GAME TESTING 🤖**

*Where AI Agents do the heavy lifting while you sip coffee and watch the magic happen*

### 💀 WARNING: This isn't your grandma's testing framework 💀

*MAGE is a military-grade, enterprise-level, AI-powered testing juggernaut that makes bugs cry*

## 🌟 What the Hell is MAGE?

**MAGE** (Multi-Agent Game Evolution Tester) is what happens when you give a bunch of AI agents espresso, lock them in a room with web games, and tell them to break everything systematically. It's not just a testing framework - it's a digital army of specialized AI agents that hunt bugs like they're playing Call of Duty.

### 🎯 Why MAGE Exists

Because clicking buttons manually is for peasants. We live in 2025, where your car drives itself, your coffee maker is smarter than some people, and your testing framework should at least be able to outsmart a game developer's "this will never break" code.

### 🚨 Reality Check

- **Manual Testing**: 1999 called, they want their methodology back
- **Automated Scripts**: Cute, but about as flexible as a Nokia 3310
- **MAGE**: *Chef's kiss* - AI that actually understands what it's testing

## 🤖 Meet Your AI Army (No Skynet Vibes, We Promise)

### **The Specialist Squad** - *Each Agent Has One Job and Does It Better Than You*

#### **🧠 PlannerAgent** - *The Mastermind*

*"I don't just make plans, I make SMART plans"*

- **Game Genre Adaptation**: Knows the difference between testing Tetris and Dark Souls
- **LangChain Integration**: Uses GPT-4 to generate test scenarios that would make QA veterans weep
- **20+ Test Case Generation**: Because 19 just isn't enough to break your game properly
#### **📊 RankerAgent** - *The Judge, Jury & Executioner*

*"Not all test cases are created equal, and I'm here to prove it"*

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Uses machine learning to rank tests by "how likely is this to find the bug that will haunt your dreams"
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates which tests will expose your game's deepest, darkest secrets
- **Top 10 Selection**: Because nobody has time for mediocre test cases
#### **⚡ ExecutorAgent** - *The Action Hero*

*"I click faster than you can say 'automated testing'"*

- **Playwright-Powered**: Browser automation so smooth it makes butter jealous
- **Multi-Instance Execution**: Runs multiple tests simultaneously because time is money
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Watches your game like a hawk watching a mouse
#### **🎯 OrchestratorAgent** - *The Conductor*

*"I make sure everyone plays in harmony, unlike your dev team"*

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Herds AI agents better than a border collie herds sheep
- **Resource Management**: Allocates system resources like a financial advisor allocates your 401k
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Schedules tasks with the precision of a Swiss watch
#### **🔍 AnalyzerAgent** - *The Detective*

*"I find patterns in chaos and chaos in patterns"*

- **Cross-Validation**: Verifies results with more scrutiny than airport security
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses machine learning to detect anomalies humans would miss
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects data like the NSA (but for good reasons)
- **Reproducibility Testing**: Ensures your bugs are consistently reproducible (unfortunately)
#### **🎯 OrchestratorAgent** - *The Conductor*
#### **🎨 GraphicsAgent** - *The Art Critic*

*"I see dead pixels"*

- **Visual Regression Testing**: Spots rendering issues before your players ragequit

- **Color Accuracy**: Ensures your game doesn't look like it was designed by a colorblind intern
#### **⚡ PerformanceAgent** - *The Speed Demon*

*"Slow games are for slow minds"*

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics with obsessive precision
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Finds performance issues faster than you can say "it's not optimized"
- **Memory Usage Analysis**: Prevents your game from eating RAM like Chrome eats battery
#### **🔒 SecurityAgent** - *The Paranoid Guardian*

*"Trust no input, verify everything"*

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Finds security holes before hackers do
- **Input Validation**: Tests every possible way users can break your game
- **Authentication Testing**: Ensures your login system isn't held together with hopes and dreams
#### **🤖 AIBehaviorAgent** - *The Behavior Analyst*

*"I judge AI behavior better than a therapist"*

- **Pathfinding Analysis**: Ensures NPCs don't walk into walls (looking at you, Skyrim)
- **Decision Making Validation**: Tests if game AI is actually intelligent or just pretending
- **Learning Pattern Analysis**: Monitors if AI learns from mistakes (unlike some developers)
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Ensures NPCs don't have multiple personality disorders

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

## 🚀 **Installation** - *Easier Than Installing Confidence in Your Code*

### **Prerequisites** - *The Boring Stuff You Need First*
#### **Step 2: Feed the Beast** - *Dependencies Galore*
# The Essentials (Non-Negotiable)
✅ Python 3.12+ (Because we live in the future)
✅ Git (For when you inevitably break something)
✅ PyQt6 (The GUI framework that doesn't hate you)
✅ OpenAI API Key (Your ticket to the AI revolution)
✅ Coffee (Optional but highly recommended)
✅ Patience (For when the AI agents become self-aware)
```

### **Installation Steps** - *Follow These or Face the Consequences*

#### **Step 3: Configuration** - *The Secret Sauce*
```bash
# Clone like you mean it
git clone https://github.com/jaynikam2005/MAGE---Multi-Agent-Game-Tester.git
cd MAGE---Multi-Agent-Game-Tester

# Create virtual environment (isolation is key)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows users, this one's for you)
#### **Step 4: Launch Into Orbit** - *The Moment of Truth*

# Linux/MacOS (because we don't discriminate)
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### **Step 2: Feed the Beast** - *Dependencies Galore*
```bash
# Install everything (yes, it's a lot)
pip install -r requirements.txt

### **Quick Start** - *For the Impatient*
poetry install

# Install Playwright browsers (because manual browser testing is medieval)
playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

#### **Step 3: Configuration** - *The Secret Sauce*
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your secrets (and we mean SECRETS)
# Add your OpenAI API key or suffer eternal 401 errors
# Configure other settings or accept the defaults like a pleb
```

#### **Step 4: Launch Into Orbit** - *The Moment of Truth*
```bash
# Start the desktop application
python src/main.py

# Or use Poetry (fancy)
poetry run python src/main.py
#### **Custom Test Scenarios** - *For the Control Freaks*
# Watch as your computer becomes sentient
```

### **Quick Start** - *For the Impatient*
```bash
# The "I want it now" installation
git clone https://github.com/jaynikam2005/MAGE---Multi-Agent-Game-Tester.git && cd MAGE---Multi-Agent-Game-Tester && python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python src/main.py

# Warning: May cause spontaneous AI uprising
